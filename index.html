    <h1>My Odin Projects</h1>
    <p>These projects were created during my time first working through <a href="https://theodinproject.com">the odin project</a> then later teaching it. Well, a lot of it was concurrent, but that isn't the point of this text. Check out the links below to find the live versions and demos of <a href="https://theodinproject.com">the odin project</a> projects.</p>
